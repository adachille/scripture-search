# scripture-search

A tool for searching scripture. Going to start with Theravada Buddhist texts, but perhaps go broader afterwards.

## Getting started

1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
2. Run `poetry install --extras dev --extras test` to set up the environment
