# Ideation

This markdown file will track some initial ideation for the project.

## Project Goals

1. Create a tool for searching scripture using natural language queries.

## Potential features

### Indexed scripture

- Scripture sources
    - Theravada Pali Canon - particularly https://www.accesstoinsight.org/index-sutta.html
    - Other scripture
        - Sutras
        - Bible

### UI

- Source selection
    - Mix and match sources - the user can choose which sources to search from.
- Search interface - a text-based interface for searching scripture.
    - _Single text search_ - Single query which gets matched to scripture.
    - _Chat-based search_ - LLM-based. User can chat with the LLM to try to refine what
      the
      user is looking for, but the LLM never tries to "be the teacher". It simply tries to
      help the user find what they are looking for.
